mazda3 i-stop : a sustainable sporting spirit
mazda to prove that a sporting spirit is not angry with respect for the environment .
for this purpose , it has integrated into the mazda3 engine arrest and launch system , called i-stop , a measure which , at least for now , is available on the gasoline engine 2.0 150 horses .
this second generation of mazda3 be seen by the note that it did in its entirety .
details , the revision of the vehicle , the habitabilité , behaviour and the mechanics , the system i-stop ...
these aspects are remarkable on the new mazda3 .
starting with the driving position , it transpires that the seats fronts have a ergonomie one hand and excellent .
the touch of the wheel is also very pleasant .
by continuing with the whole formed by both the picture of control and the equipment , we see how mazda has pursued in japan 's trend to create an internal futuristic design , with many buttons and orders , as well as vivid colors red and blue .
that style reminds us , in part , the honda civic .
therefore we can say that both the mazda3 that the civic , both japanese , contrast with moderation of german products , especially with the volkswagen golf , which all want to surpass .
in with the compact , the japanese car shop has a habitabilité more than sufficient to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort .
added to this a major trunk to regular forms .
engine arrest and start automatic system , at least for now , is available on the gasoline engine of two litres and 150 horses and with change manual of six speeds .
this engine is a true happiness . it can be illustrated by the delicacy , his low noise , its benefits and the control of its consumption .
indeed , although the most requested mazda3 are diesel models , those who do not carry out a large number of kilometres per year should not exclude this i-stop with engine speed petrol , both for his great comfort for consumption controlled .
concerning the equipment , the model chosen for the test is the sport , i.e. that constitutes the greatest number of elements of series .
among the change of road - series , the assistant equipment rvm that removes one death , the speed of traction and stability control , the regulator , the mirror internal photosensible , a computer on board on a large screen size , the independent parking sensors , air conditioning , the capteur of rain and light , the bluetooth and the bluetooth audio , as well as the wheels of alignment of 17 inches , are particularly noteworthy .
moreover , as if this equipment is not enough , this version had the pack premium for 1,500 euros more , include elements of adaptive headlights bi-xénon audio system and bose with charger records .
round-up
the mazda3 2.0 i-stop was one of the best car compactes of its category .
it illustrates in particular with the quality of the materials used , for his behaviour and his high level equipment .
moreover , those who do not carry out many miles per year will be able to choose the i-stop linked only to the gasoline engine version 2.0 of 150 horses .
the only drawback of that model is its high price , that lies between 21 770 euros for the finishing luxury and 23 270 euros for the tested , the sports model .
in return for the large sum , the mazda3 every day we provide a large degree of satisfaction .
" first ' luxury
l.a. covers the red carpet to sensualité typified by penélope cruz nicole kidman and fergie .
the stars have blinded , now more than ever vêtues models as elegant as sexys for the withdrawal of nine . - photos : gtresonline .
our ' ep ' , as sophisticated accustomed , had opted for a " lady " dark .
's promises fonpeek
peek is extremely limited , it is a system which allows only to watch his email , without giving the possibility even see kind of parts attached or to sail on the internet .
it profita his five minutes of glory in the united states , when time magazine désigna as one of the products of this year .
in truth , it is more difficult to see on the streets , but the idea seems interesting , particularly to young people .
unlike smart phones , peek offers a low prices and a monthly subscription is less than half of the cost , for example , the subscription data of the iphone .
given his success , the company launched two new devices : one designed exclusively for twitter and the other with a free service of data to life for six times more than the peek .
fonpeek , presented yesterday during the event the web , has the european version of the invention and its third incarnation .
it is so limited that its american grand-frère , but contains a surprise .
the price for its monthly subscription , about 12 euros , includes the roaming throughout europe .
those who travel with a smartphone know what represents the abandonment to data when you cross a border or seek desperately a cafeteria on the wifi - or a connection of fon to check his mail .
the idea of a at a fixed price is incredibly seductive roaming and for a long time that she should operate .
indeed , some operators have special arrangements and options voyage , but as far as i am concerned , i would need for her thesis physics to understand them and good glasses to read the small print .
repeated calls for order from the commission to propose roaming fees affordable across europe have had a barely perceptible effect .
outside their country of origin , it is reluctant to use the data , and we have not wrong .
that a small plane as fonpeek - it is always curious he is called fon when he does not possess the wifi - offers this type of tariffs , means that operators starting to think differently and study various proposals to increase their computer network .
kindle is another example , it includes downloading of books and other research on the internet .
without subscription , and without together .
it is a device connected , and it pays in his purchase and not every month .
and this is what i expect a day for the fonpeek : an option to purchase with access to life as peek proposes in the united states .
non that i want to to buy it .
i look my mail on my phones , thank you .
i hope simply because i think it is a fairer formula for the consumer .
it would be interesting to see how a computer with this same system .
colour 's preferred michelle
the yellow , without a doubt , the favourite colour of the united states ' first lady .
if it went to the assumption of office of barack obama to the presidency of the united states with a habit ' and a coat of this colour , indeed , she chose the same to accompany him in the second stage , without doubt , the most important of his life in oslo : the award of the nobel peace prize .
michelle obama was a very similar in both occasions : besides colour ressemblante model , a yellow shooting towards the green with bright , views the twice , holding consisted of three parts : the habit ' , jacket and , at the same , tissue and coats ornée of great broderie or a string .
so that a first glance , it seems that the united states ' first lady followed the aftermath of princess of asturias and chose to put the same place .
but the fabric for carved up the two blocs makes them very diverse .
if the assumption of office it was a dentelle thick , by contrast , it was in oslo a velvet printed .
the accessories are different : the shoes green to heel means for the first golden opportunity , and a similar pattern , but this time .
hairdressing too has changed : hair has now raised while it was abandoned the previous times .
75 % of the professional working mothers have had problems as a result of motherhood
discrimination at work has increased in recent years , especially for women in the younger generations who want to be mothers .
reveals that the study " fertility and women 's professional career in spain , " carried out by the csic together with the instituto de mujer .
the survey , conducted on 9 737 women from 15 to 75 , leaves no room for doubt that 75 % for working mothers have seen their professional career limited due to motherhood .
the study indicates that there are many differences regarding the beginning of life in a partnership and the number of children , whether or not the woman works and the kind of job occupied .
those who do not have any activity outside the home , work part time or have little stable , are earlier work in relationships , have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children .
however , women who have a stable job , especially in the public sector , postpone the entry into the couple living and the first pregnancy , and having fewer children .
women aged between 35 and 49 to have a fixed work have their first child , on average , 3.7 years after having built in couple . that figure rises to 4.1 among those who work in the public sector . " these data indicate that women who have a stable job requiring more time in their lives for that , which led them to postpone the union and the arrival of children .
more broadly , the type of job exercised influence the maternity leave , but less starting date of cohabitation , " explains the chercheuse the csic margarita delgado .
the level of education is another factor that widens the gap to age of marriage women and their first child .
according to the survey , the higher the training , the more they are marient , and have their first child late .
difference remains also among women of the same generation .
for example , in the group with between 35 and 49 years , those that are educated elementary and higher respectively been mothers for the first time in 25,1 and 32,1 years on average .
" another disctinction appear among women , according to their level of education .
while those who have done basic studies marient and have their first child had to find a stable job , those studies of average level or above reverse this programme and give priority to obtain a stable work as a condition for marriage and the arrival of a child , " precise mrs delgado .

be cowardly attack
last week , my mother , which has around 70 years , promenait fuenlabrada in our district of the city , when a group of young people aged between 15 and 18 rose alongside it and our dog , a sang-mélé , saved the spa and weighing no more than six kilos , and without saying a word , they assenèrent two birds of feet who grew the dog seriously injured .
outrage is huge because we do not see what is amusing to attack free a small animal defenceless , moreover , was on a leash .
this is in addition to the indignation of a woman who is promenait quietly and , when it came to fear for injuria these individuals physical integrity as a énergumène attacking an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman , a child , a ' or ultimately anyone lower than him .
the episode held at around 5 p.m. , like any other tuesday , in an area normally calm .
the dog is gémi all day .
of course , we have filed complaints to the station headquarters even if we doubt that this serve much , and not to touch the sensitivities , we just want to clarify that cowards murderers were spanish .
indignation has led to denounce this .
we do not understand what is happening to young people so that they are fun to mistreat free an animal defenceless which gives us the love , friendship and keeps us company .
we do not know where 's the good education , and the respect for animals and persons .
michelin and fesvial , groups for the port of helmet
the tyre manufacturer michelin , in collaboration with the spanish foundation for road safety , fesvial , has launched a campaign to encourage the wearing of the helmet , mainly among the motorcyclists youngsters , as said today the two structures .
this initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of the port 's helmet , since it is the only element of protection to avoid head injuries , or even death , in an accident on two wheels .
michelin said that the campaign was in keeping with his commitment to road safety , which goes beyond the design and manufacture of products more safe " and said that it helped to this goal by other actions to educational and informative .

sales of light commercial vehicles progress
after nearly two years , the market for light commercial vehicles begins to see a bit of light at the end of the tunnel .
the 9 425 vehicles registered in november in spain is an increase of 12.6 % compared to 2008 and , more importantly , they represent the first rise after 22 consecutive months of decline , according to estimates by the patronal manufacturers association anfac and ganvam , the dealers .
it is to qualify the good news , since the reference for the comparison , the november 2008 , was particularly bad , with a reduction of 60 % compared to the previous year .
accordingly , despite the events of the last month , the immatriculations accumulated during the 11 months are 40 % below in the previous financial year .
since january , if we add all vehicles coming into the category of light commercial vehicles - derived from cars , vans , pick-up fourgons light and light lorries to windows 95 853 were sold .
large clouds that affect their request did not disappear . indeed , even though they are bought by individuals , most purchases are made by small and medium enterprises , who pay in nearly 100 % of the cases thanks to an external funding .
and , in addition to the involved by restricting credit restrictions , it must add other factors such as the rise in the unemployment rate and the persistence of the bad economic situation .
faced with this situation , unlike the cars , aid to the purchase of the 2000e were served .
as well as individuals , independent and those who wish to acquire a commercial vehicle light up to 3.5 tons with a level of co2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometre , can also benefit , but the number of operations speaks for itself .
yesterday , in ganvam , it recalled once again the need for the government to pay special attention to these vehicles and also the industrial vehicles , trucks and buses .
the dealers ' association provides a 2010 similar to that end , for which it is a fall in sales - private cars and the suv of 19 % .
aid emergency brake is now required
as has occurred with the system anti-lock disincentives abs and it will take place with the stability control esp , emergency aid to brake systems compulsory will form part of the european cars .
obligatory they are already on the newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles , while the rest of the vehicle a period of has been set up to the end of february 2011 .
the measure , imposed by the european union , aims to enhance the protection of pedestrians , even if , through its mode of action , it can also help prevent many shocks back .
the attending the emergency brake is increasing pressure on the brakes in urgent cases detected by the system through the shot in the foot given by the driver .
but he does not always maintained pressure until the end .
according to a study by the manufacturer of components for cars bosch , a third drivers involved in accidents did not rely on the brakes before the collision , and half of them had not benefited from its full force .
until 1 hundred accidents
intervention of aid , revancha , requires maximum braking system , reducing the gap which the car needs to stop .
according to a study of the eu , if all cars were equipped with that sort of elements , up to 1 100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be prevented each year .
this reduction would be even more important with a popularisation emergency braking said intelligent systems : it is a sinister on four with injuries would be avoided .
in this case , the vehicle is equipped with a system that with a radar or a camera , detect obstacles and prevents driver , in addition to slightly on the brakes .
if the driver reacts , it helps by increasing the pressure on the applied , if needed .
if it does not act , although the collision is inevitable , it is the maximum effort on the brakes to minimize the damages .
general motors expanded until january the opel plan for
while the workers of the opel plant in figueruelas - zaragoza - were warned by nick reilly , the new president of general motors - gm europe , that the production of the new meriva would be launched in the first week of april , probably on 8 , according to javier ortega , the american manufacturer has warned that it will need more time to conclude the opel rescue plan .
nick reilly , the new president of gm europe , mean that every aspect of the plan was approved in advance by the relevant party .
and this could mean that the final document , which will first be subject to workers and the governments of the countries where plants , be postponed until early 2010 .
among gm , means that , however , a decision on the sale of saab should be made in the next few days .
so it is hardly surprising that the swedish government has tightened the pressure on the american manufacturer to take a decision as soon as possible .
gm admits in touch with possible new buyers .
one of them could be geely , which aspires to acquire volvo , but the application of the dutch manufacturer sports cars skyper , supported by the russian converg group , is increasing in importance .
if there is agreement with none of them , gm could sell part of saab at the chinese company baic .
close saab 's decision by the end of the year whether it is not sold holds .
driving from the porsche boxster spyder
to develop their final porsche and valuable gem , engineers have departed from the boxster s and have succeeded in the amincir nothing less than 80 kilos , leaving the balance only 1 275 kilos .
this led to happen in the first place , the automatic roof which has been replaced by a roof bâché manuel , to reduce 21 kilograms , using doors in aluminium like those of the gt3 , other 15 kilograms less , to remove the climatiseur , 13 kilograms , reduce the 64 to 54 litres of petrol tank , 7 kilograms of won , to engage in bacquets sport , yet 12 kilos , and with tyres light of 19 inches , five kilos .
finally , they gave up the audio system cdr-30 , earning six other kilograms and replaced the poignéesdes gates by handles tissues , saving the kilo remaining .
although the model also exists with the pdk box to double embrayage , the test was carried out on a model to manual box of secondary six speeds , mainly on the roads of the network of california , in the mountains , with particularly tortuous however .
his behaviour can only be called unobjectionable .
reducing weight does not mean the car to drive in the soil , with aplomb .
on the contrary , it has been that we do not tested a model as small and light which , at the same time , guarantees as secure in the however , including at high speed .
it is a small athlete , capable of échauffer her musclesà small speed during the time until we ask him to sprinter , to curb , to recover and once again to push its engine ...
out , that is what we wanted . through his leadership , as forthcoming as accurate , the car will show our hands on the steering wheel .
and they will do so with surgical precision .
its driving force at will
the sound of her constantly boxing v6 , with 320 horses - 10 more than the boxster - was particularly successful and can be strengthened with the option " sport " or through a system that is changing the rugissement the engine , already used on the panamera .
the ability of acceleration is brutal , either to halt or hopping .
suspensions are firm but not hard or uncomfortable .
road routes that we have travelled with the boyxster spyder was blighted enough , but the car has managed the nests of chicken .
electronic assistants were barely here on the whole journey , whereas in certain however we have found the ice in the early morning and the graviers , later in the morning .
ultimately , a car ultralégère , one of the most divertissantes to drive and which is much more than a simple change to the boxster s.
the car will be up for sale in february 2010 , to a price of 70 831 euros .

thank much
after days rose since the spring , when asset inflation was the dominant note on the markets , the uncertainty arises again , this is not surprising because it is a matter of their natural state , in an area where the agents to take decisions on an uncertain future by nature .
the remedy used by central banks to stabilise the markets has been to monetize debt by the direct purchase of assets and indirectly , by providing abundant liquidity rates close to zero , so that financial institutions to buy assets to mobilise .
central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchase of assets have almost been finalised , and without undermining their political maverick liquidity are starting to put a bit of sand in the machinery , such as the ecb , with their contracts to a year of next week .
consequently , investors have doubts about the ability of the global economy to maintain economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are witnessing a conversely of reducing the risk premium .
volatility scholarships and different business obligations increase again , although they remain very remote paranormaux levels they have achieved at the beginning of the year .
states were to socialising private and public debt in the danger is threatened once again .
there is again a flight to quality and the united states , japan and germany have been refuges chosen by the investors , provocative greater differences between the countries in the euro area and germany .
spain was hardly affected by the episode of instability , but then standard & poor his threatened with a new downward revision of the qualification of the kingdom of spain .
on the other hand , some uncertainty is not a bad moral risk , which advocates to silence tried again to create a case of awareness among lesresponsables of global economic policy which had hampered the destructive effects resulting from the credit limit on the destruction of the jobs , although what we should do is declare a new day of action of pardons .
but the situation of dubai is a fight between tribal sheikhs to restore its place in power in the emirates and we have already seen the case of greece .
a government that conceals a deficit , elections and a new government that saw the tub in roses .
prodi did in italy , after berlusconi and socrates portugal after durão barroso and
it is quite irrational ecofin save hungary a breach of its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a euro country not to respect its commitments .
what makes sense , however , is that the ecofin incited the greek government to transparency and make its citizens share the need to extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances .
if , as we hope , we are faced with a round of normalization of transitional risk premiums , after some excesses in positions would be predictable .
in the case of spain , until our differences in public debt increase obligations on the extent of european companies , nousn' need to worry us .
if differences and that the europeans were us continued to increase , then we would be a risk idiosyncrasique spanish .
the standard & poor 's case is an anecdote . when our forecast indicators oblige most studies services to anticipate their models of recovery and to revise upward their forecasts for 2011 , together with the oecd and the european commission , which are on the offensive with a japanese model pourl spanish economy , it adds little hope for their warning .
again , it is all seem to be an excellent opportunity to buy assets spanish , although for the moment ' caution mother safety . "

at the top of the list are the manchester united and bayern munich , the two teams , furthermore , have charged the most money for their participation in the final champions league .

there is also a bonus of victory - 800,000 euros - and equal - 400 000 for each team . those who come to huitièmes to receive final three million each , the eight teams arrive in final quarter of reçoivent3,3 million .
the past four teams will be each 4 million .
and the champion wins , 9 million compared to 5.2 received from the other final .
and , under the fixed payments , a club gain at least 7.1 million , and a maximum 31,2 million .
on the other hand , the barça was pocketed 2.5 million on winning the super european cup in august .
but there are variables , payments that are enshrined 337,8 million .
this money is distributed depending on the proportional value of each market news .
the spanish market is the one of the most significant , and have four seats attitrées .
the champion of the last year making 40 % of the money allocated , 30 % in the second , 20 % for the third and 10 % in the fourth .
another section will be paid according to the number of matches played over the edition of this year .
