for this purpose , it has integrated into the mazda3 engine arrest and launch system , called i-stop , a measure which , at least for now , is available on the gasoline engine 2.0 150 horses .
this second generation mazda3 shows by the note that it did as a whole .
details , the revision of the car , the habitabilité , behaviour , mechanics , the system i-stop ...
those issues are outstanding on the new mazda3 .
starting with the driving position , it is that the seats fronts have ergonomie and establish good .
the reach of the wheel is nice .
by continuing with all formed by the management and control both the equipment , we see how mazda continued along the tendency to create an internal futuristic design , with many japanese buttons and orders , as well as vivid colors red and blue .
this style reminds us , partly : honda civic .
so we can say that both the mazda3 both civic , japanese , contrast with moderation of german products , especially with the volkswagen golf , which all want to overcome .
in tangled with japan 's shop , this car is habitabilité more than enough for four adult travel with a high level of comfort .
adds to this great trunk the regular forms .
engine automatic arrest and start system , at least for now , is available on the gasoline engine two litres and 150 horses and change manuel six speeds .
this engine is a true joy . it shows by its delicacy , low noise , benefits and the control of its consumption .
indeed , although the most requested mazda3 are diesel models , those who do not carry out a large number of kilometres per year should not exclude this i-stop with engine speed petrol , both for his great comfort for consumption controlled .
on the equipment , the model chosen for the test is sport , in other words that has the largest number of elements of series .
among the change of road - series , the assistant equipment rvm that removes one death , the speed traction and stability control , the regulator , the internal photosensible mirror , the computer on board on a large screen size , the independent sensors parking , air conditioning , the capteur of rain and light , the bluetooth and audio , as well as the wheels of the bluetooth alignment of 17 inches , are particularly noteworthy .

:
the mazda3 2.0 i-stop are one of the best cars compactes category .
it shows in particular by the quality of materials used , his behaviour and his high level equipment .
in addition , those who do not carry out a lot of kilometres per year will be able to choose the i-stop linked solely to the gasoline engine , 2.0 version of 150 horses .

's pledge fonpeek
peek is extremely limited , it is a system which allows only to watch his email , without the opportunity to see even kind of coins attached or browsing internet .
it profita of its five minutes to glory to the united states if the magazine the désigna as one of the products of the year .
in truth , it is difficult to see in the streets , but the idea sounds interesting , especially for the young .
contrary to the smart phones , peek offers a very low price and a monthly subscription , which is less than half of the costs , for example , the subscription data of the iphone .
given his success , the company has launched two new devices : one designed exclusively for twitter and the other with a free service of data for life , for six times more expensive than the peek .
fonpeek presented yesterday at the event web , is the european version of invention and third incarnation .
it is so limited that his grand-frère us , but has a surprise .
the price for its monthly subscription approximately 12 euros , includes roaming across europe .
those who travel with a smartphone know what is the abandonment to data when you cross the border or seek desperately a cafeteria on the wifi - or a link between fon to check his mail .
an roaming at a fixed price is incredibly seductive and long it should work .
indeed , some operators have special arrangements and options trip , but as far as i am concerned , i would need for her thesis physics to understand and good glasses to read the fine print .
repeated calls for order from the commission to propose roaming fees affordable across europe had a barely perceptible effect .
outside their home country , we hesitate to use the data , and was not wrong .
as a small plane as fonpeek - it is always curious he is called fon when he does not possess the wifi - offer this kind of tariffs , means that operators starting to think differently and study various proposals to increase their data network .
kindle is another example , it includes downloading books and further work on the internet .
without charges or together .
it is a device logged and it pays in his purchase and not every month .
and i hope to see a day for fonpeek : an option to purchase with access to life as peek says in the united states .
that i want to buy .
i look my mail on my mobile , thank you .
i would simply because i believe it is a more fair formula to consumers .
it would be exciting to see a computer with this system .
colour favourite michelle
the yellow , without a doubt , the favourite colour of the united states ' first lady .
if it went to the assumption of office of barack obama to the american presidency with a habit ' and a coat of this color , indeed , she chose the same for supporting it in the second moment , without doubt , the most important of his life in oslo : the award of the nobel peace prize .
michelle obama was a very similar in both occasions : besides colour ressemblante model , a yellow shooting towards the green with bright , views the twice , holding consisted of three parts : the habit ' , jacket and , at the same , tissue and coats ornée of great broderie or a string .
so that a first glance , it seems that the united states ' first lady follow the aftermath of princess of asturias and chose to put the same kept .
but our for carved up the two blocs made them very different .
if the assumption of office it was a dentelle thick , but it was in oslo a velvet printed .
the accessories , too , are different : green shoe to heel means for the first golden opportunity , and a similar pattern , but , this time .
hairdressing too has changed : hair has now raised when she was abandoned last time .
75 % of professional working mothers had problems due to motherhood
discrimination at work has grown in recent years , especially for women of young people who want mothers .
that reveals the study fertility and career women in spain , conducted by the csic together with the instituto mujer .
the survey , conducted on 9 737 women 15 to 75 , leaves no room for doubt : 75 % for working mothers have seen their careers limited due to motherhood .
the study shows that there are many differences on the start of life in a partnership and the number of children , whether or not the woman works and occupied the kind of job .
those who did not work outside the home , work part time or have a stable work little , reached earlier in a partnership , have their first pregnancy earlier and more children .
however , women who have a stable job , mainly in the public sector , to postpone the entry in life in a partnership and the first pregnancy , and have fewer children .
women aged between 35 and 49 with fixed work have their first child , on average , 3.7 years after having built in couple . that figure rises to 4.1 among those who work in the public sector . " these data show that women have a stable job requiring more time in their lives for that , which led them to postpone the union and the arrival of children .
more broadly , the type of job wielded influence the babies , but less the starting date of cohabitation , " explains the chercheuse of csic margarita delgado .
the level of education is another factor widening the gap of age of marriage women and their first child .
according to the survey , the higher the training , the more they are marient have their first child late .
diversity remains among women of the same generation .
for example , in the group has between 35 and 49 years , those who have made basic and higher studies have been mothers respectively for the first time to 25,1 and to 32,1 years on average .
' another disctinction appears among women , according to their study .
while those who have done basic studies marient and have their first child had to find a stable job , those studies of average level or above reverse this programme and give priority to obtain a stable work as a condition for marriage and the arrival of a child , " precise mrs delgado .

this cowardly attack
last week , my mother , which has around 70 years , promenait fuenlabrada in our district of the city , when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years spent alongside and our dog , a sang-mélé , saved the spa and weighing no more than six kilos , and without saying a word , they assenèrent two birds of feet who grew the dog seriously injured .
outrage is huge because we do not see what is funny attacking free defenceless a small animal , moreover , was on a leash .
this is in addition to the indignation of a woman who is promenait quietly and , when it came to fear for injuria these individuals physical integrity as a énergumène attacking an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman , a child , a ' or ultimately anyone lower than him .
the episode came to 5 p.m. , a tuesday as one , in an area normally quiet .
the dog gémi all day .
naturally , we filed complaints to the station even if we doubt whether it furthers district of much and not to touch the sensitivities , we just want to clarify that cowards killers were spanish .
outrage has led us to denounce it .
we do not understand what is happening to young people to find fun to mistreat defenceless free an animal who gives us love , friendship and keeps us company .
we do not know where 's good education and respect animals and people .

sales of light commercial vehicles is
nearly two years after the light commercial vehicle market start to see some light at the end of the tunnel .
the 9 425 vehicles registered in november spain represent an increase of 12.6 % compared to 2008 and , more importantly , they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline , according to the figures of the patronal manufacturers association anfac and ganvam , the dealers .
however , we need to qualify the good news , as a reference for the comparison , the november 2008 , was particularly bad , with a loss of 60 % compared with the previous year .
as a result , despite the events of last month , the immatriculations gathered during the 11 months are 40 % below those of the previous year .
since january , if we add all vehicles entering the category of light commercial vehicles - derived from cars , pick-up vans , fourgons light and light trucks to windows 95 853 were sold .
high clouds that affect their request did not removed . in fact , despite being bought by individuals , most of the purchases are made by small and medium enterprises , who pay in nearly 100 % with external funding .
in more restrictions involved by restricting credit , we must say other factors such as the rise in the unemployment rate and the continuation of the bad economic situation .
in this situation and unlike the cars , support for the purchase of the 2000e were used .
also individuals , the independent and those who wish to acquire a commercial vehicle slightly less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of co2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometre , can also benefit , but the number of operations speaks for itself .
yesterday , in ganvam , it recalled once again the need for the government to pay special attention to these vehicles and also the industrial vehicles , trucks and buses .
the dealers ' association provides a 2010 similar to that is over , why it is falling sales , from cars and the suv 19 % .
aid emergency brake is now required
as took place with the system anti-lock brakes abs and it will take place with the stability control esp , emergency aid to brake systems will be mandatory part on european cars .
mandatory are already on the newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles , while the rest of a period of vehicles has been set up to end february 2011 .
the measure , imposed by the european union , aims to enhance the protection of pedestrians , although action , by the way , it can also help prevent many blows back .
the attending the emergency brake is increasing pressure on the emergency brakes detected by the system through shot up given by the driver .
but it has not always pressure until the end .
according to a study by the manufacturer of car components bosch , a third drivers involved in an accident did not rely on the brakes before the collision , and half of them did not benefit from its full force .
until 1 hundred accidents
what aid , revancha , requires maximum braking system , cutting the distance the car needs to stop .
according to a study by the eu , if all cars were with this kind of points , up to 1 100 pedestrian fatalities in which are involved could be prevented each year .
this reduction would be even greater with popularisation of ' smart emergency braking systems : it is a sinister on four with injuries would be avoided .
in this case , the vehicle is equipped with a system that , thanks to a radar or a camera , detect obstacles and warns the driver in addition to do slightly on the brakes .
if drivers reacts , it applied by increasing pressure on the aid , if needed .
if it does not act , that the crash is inevitable , it has a maximum effort in checks to minimize the damage .

nick reilly , the new president of gm europe wants each of the plan was approved in advance by the side .
and this may mean that the final document will first be submitted to workers and the governments of the countries where plants , be postponed until early 2010 .
yet among gm , means that a decision on the sale of saab should take place within the next few days .
so it is no wonder that the swedish government has stepped up pressure on us manufacturer to take a decision soon .
gm agrees in touch with possible new buyers .
one of them could also be geely , which seeks to acquire dutch volvo , but the application of the manufacturer of sports cars skyper , backed by the russian group converg , is becoming more important .
if there would agree with any of them , gm could sell part of saab chinese company baic .
close saab 's decision at the end of this year so it is not sold holds .

on the contrary , it was until we had tested a model small and light , at the same time , guarantees as secure the however , including at high speed .
it is a small athlete , able to échauffer its musclesà small speed during the time , until we asked him to sprinter , to curb , to recover and to push his engine ...

the sound of her constantly boxing v6 , with 320 horses - 10 more than the boxster - was particularly successful and can be strengthened with the option " sport " or through a system which amends engine rugissement , already used on the panamera .
the ability of acceleration is brutal , both ruling or hopping .
suspensions are uncomfortable farms but not hard .
road surface we have used with the boyxster spyder was blighted enough , but the car has managed the nests chicken .
electronic workers were barely here on all the way , while certain however we have found the ice in the early morning and graviers , later in the morning .
in short , a car ultralégère , most divertissantes to lead , and which is much more than a simple change to the boxster s.
the car will be for sale in february 2010 at a cost of 70 831 pounds .

the game started quickly to the blue and red , which took the advantage from the start .
the fact that the first four baskets of vitoria 's team should be conducted for the ring , was a sign that they had jumped on the ground with the israeli poignets hot .
english and teletovic were the main sponsors of final 18-20 prime quart-temps .
the second quart-temps was in the same tone , but the team of internal barac alava has chosen the game and the eliyahu , who has been received with cheers and applause to return to his old house , to increase their advantage in the break - 34-43 .
teletovic already began to draw attention to themselves as the best player of his team , with 13 points scored , while the least six ' assessment of splitter was already predict that night was never going to be the best in the brazilian .
but in this game , despite the fact that they were on the right track to the break , nothing was played , far from it , and the team of avala sought to remind of vitoria do not win so easily on their land , and thanks to the hand of elias , they succeeded in entering the match .

the unicaja lost loudly in greece over the olympiacos and gave him the lead in group b of the euroligue , in a match marked by the absence of the unicaja players , especially in the internal game - freeland , lima and greek archibald - which have facilitated the victory .
malaga 's team was not frightened by the mood of the flag of peace and friendship and the scale of the rival , probably one of the most powerful of europe with a big budget .

thanks
after days roses asset since last spring , when inflation was the dominant note on the markets , uncertainty arises again , which is not surprising because it is their natural state , in an area where the agents to take decisions on an uncertain future in nature .
the remedy used by central banks to stabilise the markets has been to monetize debt through the direct purchase of assets and indirectly with abundant liquidity rates close to zero , so that financial institutions to buy assets to mobilise .
central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchase of assets have almost been finalised , and without undermining their political maverick liquidity are starting to put a bit of sand in the machinery , such as the ecb , with their contracts to a year of next week .
investors therefore doubt the ability of the global economy to maintain an economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are witnessing a vice versa of reducing risk premiums .
volatility grants and different corporate bonds rise again , although they remain distant paranormaux levels they have met at the beginning of the year .
states were forced socialising risk private and public debt is threatened once again .
there is again a flight to quality and the united states , japan and germany were shelter chosen by investors , provocative growing differences between germany and the euro zone countries .
spain has been barely affected by this episode of unstable , but then standard & poor his threatened with a new downward revision of the evaluation of the kingdom of spain .
on the other hand , some uncertainty is not a bad moral risk , which advocates to silence tried again to create a case of awareness among lesresponsables of global economic policy which had impeded the destructive effects resulting from the credit limit on the destruction of employment , and what we should do is declare a new day of pardons .
however , the situation of dubai looks like a fight between tribal sheiks to restore its place in the power in the emirates , and we have already seen the case of greece .
a government which hides a deficit , elections and a new government which finds the tub with roses .
prodi did italy after berlusconi and socrates portugal durão barroso .
it is quite irrational ecofin saves hungary a breach of its external payments at the start of the year and allow a euro country not to fulfil its commitments .
this is logical , however , is that the ecofin incited the greek government to transparency and give its people share the need of extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances .
if , as expected , we have a transitional round of normalization of risk premium , after some excesses in positions would be expected .
in the case of spain , until our differences in public debt has risen to match the bonds of european companies , nousn' need to worry us .
and that if european gaps were ours continued to rise , then we would be a risk idiosyncrasique spanish .
the standard & poor 's case is an anecdote . when our forecast indicators force most studies services to anticipate their models of recovery and to revise upward their forecasts for 2011 , with the oecd and the european commission , which are on the offensive with a japanese pourl spanish economy model , it adds little hope for their warning .
again , it is all seem to be a good opportunity to buy assets spain , although for the moment " caution is mother safety . "

participating in the champions league to real madrid and barça told 476,4 million since its creation
the champions league has become a source of income for the clubs since its birth in 1992 .
indeed , the real madrid and the f.c. barcelona won 467,4 million , which put them in third and fifth position of the clubs that have earned the more money in this contest .
the manchester united tops the list .
the manchester united tops the list .
win the uefa champions league does not only show . this is also one of the main sources of income for big clubs .
indeed , the competition has distributed 5 362,5 million euros to 105 - including 12 spanish teams that participated in the event since the creation of the tournament , during the 1992 season , according to information from the uefa .
the f.c. barcelona and real madrid were well served at this division .
white the club has been the third of the continent to reach the more money for his involvement , and the only , with the a.c. milan , has won three times the laurels .
the catalan club , now taking the title and final winner of the old european cup in 1992 , is fifth on the list .
at the top are a manchester united and bayern munich , the two teams who have charged , in addition , the more money for their involvement in the last champions league .
this , although they lost in the barça .
on the other hand , spain is only the third country , on money reported by the champions league , although it has won more titles than any other , five , while italy won four , england and germany , two - three .
-
this seeming paradox is the complex procedure for distributing money applied by uefa .
this year 's body headed by michel platini will earn 1 090 million from the champions league .
of this amount , uefa will 413,1 million fixed payments : each of the 20 clubs , which have engaged to classification matches , including the atlético madrid , has received 2.1 million .
moreover , those who have managed to get received only to be 3.8 million , in addition to 550 midnight euros for each match played .
there is also a bonus in case of victory - 800,000 euros and equal - 400 000 for each team . those who arrive in huitièmes final three million each , perceive the eight teams arrive in final quarter of reçoivent3,3 million .
the last four teams will each . 4 million
and champion wins final 9 million from 5.2 received by the other .
so at fixed payments , a club will at least 7.1 million , and the maximum 31,2 million .
of the barça has earned 2.5 million on winning the european super cup in august .
but there are varying payments , which goes 337,8 million .
that money is distributed according to proportional value of each market news .
the spanish market is one of the biggest , and have four attitrées markets .
the champion of last year is making 40 % of the money earmarked , 30 % in the second , 20 % in the third and 10 % in the fourth .
the other side will be made according to the number of matches played at edition of this year .

the database includes 1 034 , whose 666 to cars , 109 tout-terrains , 137 bikes , 78 vans and 44 lorries .
naturally , to use a computer and internet connection is needed .
once the model to repair identified thanks to its copy of windows , a graphic image model in question is can you really selects the coin needed .
the user can include variables such as the price of the workforce , supplements or cuts , then he can set the estimate to get to the customer .
audataller is not a tool of estimate as audaplus but a litany of references .
the difference between these two systems than for garages do not include the time of estimated workforce .
the cost to use this tool in the garage of 350 per year , which can be credit .
now , the company audatex works for that images are three dimensions .
this is something that engineers see a very positive , as it will , for example , to select a door and turn to see the internal front .
